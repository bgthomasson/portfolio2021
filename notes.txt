ART PORTFOLIO EXAMPLE

1. landing page 
a. gallery (sorted?) 
b. individual item info 
c. commission info - types, prices, TOS, status (or link to where it is updated) 
d. store (elsewhere) 
e. contact info (mail, other sites) 
f. about me (maybe an FAQ?)

Examples of real sites: 
1. main page with thumbs as links. banner and navbar top, other site links at bottom. links- gallery, store (ext), commission info, about

2. main with 9 big img (carousel), pages: about, faq, commission info, contact. 

3. main with pages. banner + nav on top, external links on bottom. instagram thumbs on side. 

store sites seem to have a 3 col thumb layout. except redbubble which actually uses a grid unlike the one that was all floats. 

option 1: "almost one page" with all info on main, thumbs link to itempages. 
pro: efficient, simple. 
con: a little heavy, maybe too much scrolling? 

FANCY
alternate between text and images! 
container, box with 3 examples, box with text 40 em wide centered

stickers.
sketches.
colorings.

--------
Version A1 "single page with alternate sections" is OK. 
1. should it all be center aligned, and how to do that?
As in, just text-align the whole durn thing or force the boxes to the middle? 

2. are those colors OK?? I feel like it's too harsh all dark. 
the <main> bg is fine but it needs texture? also dark warm colors are muddy. 

3. image links- only on biggest to see fullsize? For now using links to Imgur as most pragmatic. 
Ideally will be self hosted on production site!!!

OH yes. Absolutely must look good on a phone at a con!!! 
Portable portfolio!! 
However, that throws a kink in things. I used dark by default so images stand out more, but...
if you're in some well lit or outdoor place then that'll turn it into an obsidian mirror and hide the text, right!?
(However I think overall it's the better default since being blinded in bed is worse than having to squint a bit outdoors, right?)
So gotta have toggle dark/light, but how?
If it was simply desktop then @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark/light) would be enough but as I said- mobile! 
user needs to be able to switch based on current environment, so we need a button. 

OK found an example from CSS tricks! Just using JS since a plain static website. 
SInce it's fairly basic concept I'm OK with just borrowing it >.>;;

However it is VERY fragile, I think because specifying the body classs? changing ANYTHING can fuck it up. 
oh also maybe the saving settings goofs up when constantly refresshing to check minor edits lol. 
For some reason --links works fine in dark mode but not light mode!?!? it's black instead of blue!
edit: later it did things right, SNAFU.

img loading='lazy'
or/also wrap in <picture> so we have small versions for mobile/thumbnails ??
I think for mobile with tiny screen and data caps that is best, but I'm not sure how to handle desktop. 
Use the small thumbs and have a note to "click on to see full"?
Use big thumbs and "click on to see gigantic" on the ones that are super big?

<picture>
    <source srcset="dragon-huge.jpg" type="image/jpg" media="(min-width: 900px)">
    <img src="dragon-400px.webp" type="image/webp" alt="dragon thumb">
    // JPG fallback? //

WebP has ~90% support. falls within supported FF and Chrome 80+, and Safari seems to well enough.
