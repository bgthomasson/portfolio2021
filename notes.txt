ART PORTFOLIO EXAMPLE

1. landing page 

a. gallery (sorted?) 
b. individual item info 
c. commission info - types, prices, TOS, status (or link to where it is updated) 
d. store (elsewhere) 
e. contact info (mail, other sites) 
f. about me (maybe an FAQ?)



EX:
Goldenwolf has a main page with thumbs as links. banner and navbar top, other site links at bottom. 
links- gallery, store (ext), commission info, about

Vex has main with 9 big img (carousel), pages: about, faq, commission info, contact. 

tanidareal also main with pages. banner + nav on top, external links on bottom. instagram thumbs on side. 

store sites seem to have a 3 col thumb layout. 
except redbubble which actually uses a grid unlike the one that was all floats. 



option 1: "almost one page" with all info on main, thumbs link to itempages. 
pro: efficient, simple. 
con: a little heavy, maybe too much scrolling?
